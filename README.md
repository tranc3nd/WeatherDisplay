In this project, I developed an IoT application to retrieve and display weather information for specified locations using a TM4C123 LaunchPad, CC3100 Booster Pack, and ST7735R Color LCD. The system prompts users to input a city name, ID, coordinates, or zip code, then retrieves weather data from openweathermap.org and displays it on the LCD, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. This project built upon previous coursework, incorporating topics such as GPIO, Interrupts, UART, and WiFi communication. Despite challenges with API data retrieval, Keil uVision's memory constraints, and displaying animations, I successfully created a functional and informative weather display system. Links to the demo video and schematics are included in the repository.
