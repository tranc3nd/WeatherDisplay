In this project, I created a communication system using two TM4C123 LaunchPads and a Nokia5110 LCD, utilizing UART modules to send data between the PC and the microcontrollers. This project required a deep understanding of UART communication, FIFO queues, and integration with previous concepts like GPIOs, Interrupts, and the PLL system clock. We implemented three modes: setting LED colors, toggling and confirming LED states between the microcontrollers, and displaying messages on the LCD. Despite challenges, particularly with FIFO data transmission, we successfully achieved communication between the PC and microcontrollers, gaining valuable insights into UART communication and microcontroller integration. Links to our demo video and detailed schematics are included in the repository.
